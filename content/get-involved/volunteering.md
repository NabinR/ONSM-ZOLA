ONSM organises biennial sporting events, called the Oceania Nepali Sports Meet, featuring a range of sports competitions drawing hundreds of athletes from Australia and New Zealand and the other countries in the Oceania region. An event of such a scale is not possible without help of our dedicated volunteers. ONSM is ever grateful to all of our volunteers who make our events a great success.

Please contact us for more information on how you can help out in our next big event.
