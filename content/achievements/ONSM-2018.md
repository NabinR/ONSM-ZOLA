    We are pleased to announce that 4th Oceania Nepali Sports Meet <b>(ONSM)</b> has successfully concluded in Sydney, NSW. A marathon schedule of nine sports with 32 sub-categories were held in nine locations during Easter weekend (Fri 30 March to Mon 02 April 2018). Opening and Closing Ceremonies were held to highlight the importance of Nepali sporting men and women gathering at one place and competing on the sport of their choice, as well as, opportunity to Network. This "Mini Olympic" also provides a pathway for younger generation and aspiring athletes  into mainstream sporting events of the countries, now, we call home.
</p>
<p>
    Over 800 players, from all states & territories of Australia, New Zealand and for the first time Papua New Guinea, of Nepali origin participated in the social yet competitive tournament of <b>5 KM Run, Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Golf, Lawn Tennis, Soccer, Table Tennis and Volleyball</b>. The smooth running of the events was assisted by hundreds of dedicated volunteers of Nepalese Recreational Club <b>(NRC)</b>, Nepalese Cricket Association, Australia <b>(NCAA)</b>, Machhapuchhre Football Club <b>(MFC)</b>, Buzzer Basketball Club <b>(BBC)</b>, Myagdi Overseas Nepalese Association <b>(MONA)</b>, Bridge The Gap Nepal <b>(BGTN)</b>, Association of Nepalese Medical & Dental Association <b>(ANMDA)</b>, Nepindo Group and members of Nepalese community in Sydney.
</p>
<p>
    Since its inception in 2013, the sports meet has been the biggest sporting event for people of Nepali origin in the Oceania region, and now coming to its 4th edition it is probably the biggest gathering of Nepali sporting men & women outside of Nepal. The main objectives of the sport meet are:
</p>
<p>
    (1) networking and developing a strong bond among the diverse Nepalese communities through competitive sports,
    <br />(2) acknowledging the great sporting talents, we have,
    <br />(3) providing pathways for younger generation to compete in the mainstream events, and
    <br />(4) promoting various sports for health benefits.
</p>
<p>
    We would like to congratulate all winners, as well as, like to encourage all participants to be active and take part in future sporting events. After all, the health benefit that we get from staying active far outweighs the mere winning of a competition. Sincere thanks to all the players and supporting crews for your hard-work and wonderful efforts. We hope to see much more of your sporting talent in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
    We, on behalf of the organizers, would like to thank all the players who travelled from their home cities to Sydney to participate in the event.

<p>
    We would like to thank all the volunteers who worked tirelessly during the entire event including the award presentation ceremony and gala dinner. Our appreciation goes to all the referees, who helped us run the competitions without any disruption and disputes.  This event would not have been possible without the generous support of our sponsors.

Thanks to all the media partners, who played a significant role in promoting this event.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks to all who worked on the front and behind the scene in various roles and at various stages of the event to make it a grand success. Special thanks to the families who provided accommodation to the interstate participants. Thanks to all the guests who travelled all the way from Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Adelaide, Perth, Tasmania, New Zealand and PNG to attend this event.
</p>
<p>
    Our sincere thanks also goes to all the members of the local Nepalese communities in and around Sydney for providing great encouragement to the players participating in the sport meet.
</p>
<p>
    Last but not the least, our sincere thanks to all the members of the ONSM co-ordination committee, various sports coordinators, EC members, advisers and friends & families of NRC. Without your help, this would have never been possible.
</p>
<p>
    Organizing the event of this magnitude has been a learning curve for us. Despite putting our efforts, we experienced some lapses here and there. We will review them and come up with recommendations to further improve the next ONSM event. We will be sending survey questionnaire to all of you and request your honest response so that we can compile these feed backs to guide our future ONSM events.
</p>
